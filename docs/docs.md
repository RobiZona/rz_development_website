# Welcome to RZ Documentation

Welcome to the official **RZ Development** documentation.

Here you’ll find **clear, practical documentation** for all our scripts:  
installation steps, configuration examples, notes about performance, and things that can (and will) break if you ignore them.

No marketing. Just docs.

---

## What You’ll Find Here

This documentation is organized by **platform and script**:

- **Scripts** – Installation guides and configuration references
- **Examples** – Real configuration examples, not placeholders
- **Notes** – Known limitations, performance tips, edge cases
- **Updates** – Version info and changelogs where relevant

Use the **sidebar** to navigate between platforms and scripts, or use the **search** if you already know what you’re looking for.

---

## Supported Platforms

Scripts are grouped by platform:

- **RedM**
- **FiveM**

Each script page clearly states:
- supported frameworks
- required dependencies
- configuration options
- version and changelog reference

---

## Quick Start

Most scripts follow the same basic flow:

1. **Download** the resource
2. **Place it** in your resources folder
3. **Configure** the provided files
4. **Ensure / start** the resource
5. **Check logs** if something doesn’t work

If a script requires **extra steps**, they are always documented on its page.

---

## Version & Changelog

Each script includes:
- current version
- changelog sourced directly from the resource

If something changed, it’s documented.  
If it’s not documented, assume it didn’t change.

---

## Need Help?

If something doesn’t work:

- Re-read the **installation section**
- Check the **configuration examples**
- Look at the **changelog**
- Then ask for support

Support links are provided where applicable, but **documentation comes first**.

---

## Notes

This documentation grows together with the scripts.  
Some pages may be minimal at first and expand over time.

That’s intentional.
