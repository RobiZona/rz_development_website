## What is this?

This repository contains the **documentation website** for RZ Development.

- provide installation & configuration guides
- expose versions and changelogs
- keep everything static, fast, and predictable

The site is **platform-agnostic**.  
Scripts are grouped by platform (RedM, FiveM, etc.) inside the documentation.
